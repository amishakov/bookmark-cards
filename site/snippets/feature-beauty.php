  <h2><mark>Feature #3</mark>: Did you notice the brands already?</h2>
  <p>
    <b>To make Bookmark.cards more beauty, manually crafted brand name icons have been used as background.</b> 
    <br />
    <small><i>(Bookmark.cards is not affiliated with the brands in any way. It is just a beauty thingy.)</i></small>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a brand name in the title to apply brand as background dynamically.</li>
    <li>Unfortunately, not all brand names are covered.</li>
    <li>In case you miss a brand, feel free to drop a message. (Or contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/kreativ-anders/brand-names">GitHub</a> repository.)</li>
  </ul>
